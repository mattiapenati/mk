This file contains the list of the packages contained in the base setup of each
toolchain. The packages are listed in the order of installation, with its own
dependencies:

  make: no dependencies
    GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other
    non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

  diffutils: no dependencies
    GNU Diffutils is a package of several programs related to finding
    differences between files.

  m4: no dependencies
    GNU M4 is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor.

  libtool: m4
    GNU libtool is a generic library support script. Libtool hides the
    complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent, portable
    interface.

  flex: m4, libtool
    Flex is a tool for generating scanners.

  bison: m4
    Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated
    context-free grammar into a deterministic LR or generalized LR (GLR)
    parser employing LALR(1) parser tables.

  db: libtool
    Berkeley DB is a family of embedded key-value database libraries providing
    scalable high-performance data management services to applications.

  gdbm: libtool
    GNU dbm is a set of database routines that use extensible hashing. It works
    similar to the standard UNIX dbm routines.

  perl: db, gdbm
    Perl 5 is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 27
    years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from portables to
    mainframes and is suitable for both rapid prototyping and large scale
    development projects.

  gmp: libtool
    GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
    signed integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.

  mpfr: gmp, libtool
    The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
    computations with correct rounding.

  mpc: gmp, mpfr, libtool
    GNU MPC is a C library for the arithmetic of complex numbers with
    arbitrarily high precision and correct rounding of the result.

  gawk: mpfr, libtool
    The awk utility interprets a special-purpose programming language that
    makes it possible to handle simple data-reformatting jobs with just a few
    lines of code.

  autoconf: m4, gawk, perl
    Autoconf is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell scripts
    to automatically configure software source code packages.

  pkgconf: autoconf
    pkgconf is a program which helps to configure compiler and linker flags for
    development frameworks. It is similar to pkg-config, but was written from
    scratch in the summer of 2011 to replace pkg-config.

  ncurses: pkgconf, libtool
    The Ncurses (new curses) library is a free software emulation of curses in
    System V Release 4.0, and more.

  readline: ncurses
    The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by
    applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in.

  (recompile gawk because of circular dependency gawk <> readline)

  bash: readline
    Bash is the Bourne Again SHell. Bash is an sh-compatible shell that
    incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).
    It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and
    Tools standard.
